## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: Zustand for authentication state
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Schema Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking
- **Session Management**: Basic authentication (to be enhanced with proper JWT)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with structured error handling

### Development Environment
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with path mapping
- **Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error overlay for development

## Key Components

### Database Schema (Drizzle ORM)
- **Users**: Enhanced authentication with password hashing, 2FA, and session management
- **Companies**: Organization information and relationships
- **Customers**: Customer profiles with company associations
- **Leads**: Prospect management with status tracking
- **Deals**: Sales pipeline with stages and probability
- **Tasks**: Activity management with types and priorities
- **Activities**: Historical activity tracking
- **Contacts**: Contact information management
- **Security Tables**:
  - **AuditLogs**: Comprehensive tracking of all security events
  - **PasswordResetTokens**: Secure password reset token management
  - **UserSessions**: Active session tracking with expiration
  - **TwoFactorAuth**: TOTP secret storage for 2FA

### Frontend Pages & Features
- **Dashboard**: Metrics overview, recent activities, pipeline summary
- **Customers**: Customer management with CRUD operations
- **Leads**: Lead tracking and conversion management
- **Pipeline**: Visual sales pipeline with drag-and-drop (planned)
- **Tasks**: Task and activity management
- **Contacts**: Contact directory and management
- **Reports**: Analytics and reporting dashboard
- **Admin**: User management and system settings
- **Security**: Personal security settings, 2FA management, session control
- **Authentication**: Enhanced login with 2FA support, password reset flow

### UI Component System
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui with consistent styling
- **Color Scheme**: CSS custom properties for easy theming
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant components from Radix UI

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials
2. Backend validates password using bcrypt hash comparison
3. System checks for account lockout and failed login attempts
4. If 2FA is enabled, user must provide TOTP code
5. System generates JWT token and creates secure session
6. Frontend stores user state, token, and session ID
7. Protected routes check authentication status
8. All security events are logged in audit trail

### API Request Flow
1. Frontend components use TanStack Query hooks
2. API requests go through centralized `apiRequest` function
3. Express.js routes handle CRUD operations
4. Storage layer abstracts database operations
5. Drizzle ORM handles PostgreSQL interactions
6. Responses return JSON with error handling

### Form Handling
1. React Hook Form manages form state
2. Zod schemas validate input data
3. Form submissions trigger API mutations
4. TanStack Query invalidates related cache
5. UI updates reflect changes immediately

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **zod**: Schema validation
- **zustand**: Client state management
- **wouter**: Lightweight routing

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant management
- **lucide-react**: Icon library
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **typescript**: Type checking
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- Backend: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Single deployment artifact with served static files

### Database Management
- **Automatic Setup**: Run `node init-database.js` for complete database initialization
- **Schema Files**: All 23 tables defined in `./shared/schema.ts`
- **Migration System**: Drizzle migrations in `./migrations` directory
- **Environment Variables**: `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET` required
- **Manual Commands**: `npm run db:push`, `drizzle-kit generate`, `drizzle-kit push`
- **Initial Data**: Automatically creates default tenant and admin user
- **Login**: admin@awmicro.com / password

### Environment Configuration
- Development: `npm run dev` runs both frontend and backend
- Production: `npm run build && npm start`
- TypeScript checking: `npm run check`

### Hosting Considerations
- Backend serves both API routes and static frontend
- PostgreSQL database required (Neon recommended)
- Environment variables needed for database connection
- Node.js runtime required for Express.js server

The application follows modern full-stack patterns with type safety throughout, efficient caching strategies, and a component-based UI architecture suitable for scaling and maintenance.
